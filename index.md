## Good-by’s

I know things  
That I shouldn't  
Somehow I can sniff out  
The brevity of life  
Like a brew  
That has dripped  
Its last  
Drop  
Crop it out  
Tear it up  
That premonition still remains  
I know not how  
I don't know when  
But I shall not remain  
I will live like fuel  
I will burn like lactic  
As I grab onto the mule  
But when all the fun  
Has run out and gone  
I know the things  
I should

it’s complexities draw me in  
it’s a puzzle  
no, a syringe  
a lullaby to the  
hard desk wood  
& a stark slap to  
the dreary fools  
blinking away  
their sullen mood  
in wake of their torment  

draught or not  
it lures you in  
a siren of the sheet  
the charcoal grind  
With pink remains  
a ruiner to even the meek  
the solution varies  
but not to distress  
the answer lies in you  
because if 2+2  
is the square root of 4  
 you must be a fool too
