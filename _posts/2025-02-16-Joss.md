its uncanny, the amount of tears, screams, shouts, and laughters emerges from the olympic competition. from track to gymnastics to swimming, ive truly witnessed how athletes at peak performance come through under high pressure situations. its funny because my current internship is all about high pressure. we are studying how a mediated amount of force on a sample under a high pressure situation chages its phases, constitution, temperature, and other factors. there are some computer components like using bash commands and potentially using python? (not sure but it was mention). now when looking at these athletes, you can see how everything either comes together - or it doesn’t. while their electron constitution may not rearrange itself due to a loss, but the breakdown of dissapointment that emerges from failure comes suprisingly close. for example, christian coleman. the whole indoor season, this man worked insanely hard to perform well in the 60m, one of his better events. when noah lyles joined the stage this year, it was at first a ridiculous thought that he could every upset christian coleman in a 60m. in this short sprinting event, the start is one of he most vital components. with a bad start, there is not enough time to make up for the lack of reactivity. and noah lyles used to be the defenition of a very supbar block start. which is exactly why his coach focused heavily on noahs 60m this indoor. noah did average his first few times on the track, until each competition it was visible that he was improving - grealty. he started to become competitive to christian, and eventualy started to beat christan? this was an upset of all time as christian is known to be the best block starter alive. his reactivity sets him a couple meters infront of his competitors only one to two seconds into the race. however with noah fixing his block starts, his top end speed kept clipping christian at the end of the 60m. however, at the world championships christian was able to hold him off and become the indoor world champion of this distance. now in the 100m outdoors, it would be expected for cc (chrisitan coleman) to make the team. but he didnt. his finals race was definently not his best. it was close, but the time he ran was nothing compared to how he did at the world championships last year. he couldnt even manage a third place finish, allowing fred kerley to snag it at the very end. and it was visible how heartbroken cc was. i mean not even making the team? when he was considered an olympic favorite? it simply doesnt make sense to a human being, but it does when it is realized that the track sport is unforgivable and tempermental. take athing mu, who seemed abesolutely guranteed to make the olympic team for the 800. however, she fell in just the first 200m which effectively took her out of the race. and she was heartbroken and sobbed as she walked off the track. it is depressing to think about all the work these athletes put in behind the scenes that eventually culminate in failure. they push their body to the limit, working out with extremely dificult parameters, flying all over the world, restricitng every single type of food that goes into their body, forcing recovery even when not necessary everyday, cancelling plans and distancing yourself from friends because you simply do not have the time to “hang out” when you are fully occupied wih your mission to become an olympic athlete, crying over meets that dont go right and fretting over block starts, false starts, finishes, pain, injury. oh injury. the deadly siren song of any sport. sometimes from actions not taken, other from total accident.. it physces one out physically and mentally. it can take months to heal, and longer for your mind to push your body to the limit knowing injuring yourself that way is now even more possible. even more plausible, even more likely, though you dont like it, the likes of it are centripital. talking of circular forces, full circle events in these sports can be quite stunning. while athing mu fell and subsequently got last place in the final, the girl that got first fell in her last olympic trial which also impeded her. that is insane. she went from a failure to an olympic trial winner. even gabby thomas. this is probably not fully accurate, but i think around the years 21-22 she was having a very hard time running fast. i think she was injured or somehting of the sort, but all her times were very disgraceful. mid elevens and twenty threes highlighted her season. now she is olympic trials champion. masai russel, who has not had that “click” occur until the trials. ive been watching her this year, and throughout this outdoor season she has seriously not been a factor in the hurdles in any race she has been in. the only one she was, was because everyone else was not notable and she won even though they all ran very slow times. however, she put in the work. she didnt get disccoruaged by the way the season was going. she trusted God, and she won. olympic trials champion, which is insane. a new pb as well in the span of just three or so days.
